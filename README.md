# React Native exploration

I am experimenting with React Native: getting familiar with development and getting apps online.

## Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/industriousparadigm/explore-react-native.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd explore-react-native
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Expo Development Server**:
   - Run the following command to start the Expo development server:
     ```bash
     expo start
     ```
   - This will open up a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo developer tools.

4. **Run on a Simulator/Emulator**:
   - Ensure you have Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android) set up.
   - In the Expo developer tools in your browser, click on "Run on iOS simulator" or "Run on Android emulator".

5. **View Logs and Debug**:
   - The Expo developer tools in the browser allow you to view logs, debug, and access various developer options.

## How to Run on Your iPhone

To run the app on your iPhone, follow these steps:

1. **Install Expo Go App**

2. **Start the Expo Development Server**:
   - See the steps in "Run Locally" above.

3. **Connect to the Same Wi-Fi Network**:
   - Make sure your development machine and iPhone are on the same Wi-Fi network.

4. **Scan QR Code with Expo Go**:
   - Open the Expo Go app on your iPhone.
   - Scan the QR code available in the Expo developer tools in your browser or in the terminal where you ran `expo start`.
   - This will open your project in the Expo Go app.

5. **Development and Testing**:
   - You can now develop and test your app. Any changes you make will be reflected in the app running in Expo Go.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues, ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed and that your project's dependencies are up to date.
- For issues specific to running on an iPhone, check that your phone's Expo Go app is updated.
